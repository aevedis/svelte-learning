# Svelte self-learning repo

Howdy, this repo is meant to keep myself accountable, to force me to push some new code every week for a great Udemy course I am taking.

Frontend development is not my main field of expertise, as I work as a Data Scienist. I do recognize, however, the importance of being

do marvels for 90% of use cases, but there's that additional 10% that truly bothers me.

So yeah, let's see what I'll be able to pull-off!
